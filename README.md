# MADINI-Dataset
The MADINI (Material Data in Northern Italy) dataset consists of three relational databases of amphorae, red-slipped finewares, and decorative stone. In total, 58,743 individual entries are recorded across the dataset from 39 urban sites within Northern Italy. 

The dataset does not claim to be a comprehensive collection of all amphorae, finewares, and decorative stone in marble recovered from published Roman contexts within the region. Instead, it seeks to provide a representative sample of urban assemblages in Northern Italy. 

An analysis of the MADINI dataset can be found in:

The MADINI dataset of amphorae, finewares, and decorative stone forms a complex, yet powerful tool to analyse trade networks and the economy in Northern Italy. The following sections provides details on the component MADINI databases (AMINI, REFINI, and DESTINI) and the structure of the data within them. 

## Amphorae in Northern Italy (AMINI)
The AMINI database contains 28,323 sherds of amphora from 32 urban sites across Northern Italy. It comprises of five interconnected tables, the contents of which are outlined as follows.
1.	AMINI Catalogue Table (28,323 entries). This is the main database table which holds a single entry for each amphora sherd. It lists detailed information about the sherd and includes a link to all other tables in the database. Epigraphic data is also recorded in this table.
2.	AMINI Deposits Table (200 entries). This table contains chronological and contextual information about the archaeological deposit in which amphora sherds listed in the Catalogue table were found. 
3.	AMINI Locations Table (32 entries). This table contains information about each urban site in which amphora sherds listed in the Catalogue table were found.
4.	AMINI Publications Table (62 entries). This table contains information on each publication that recorded the amphora sherds found in the Catalogue table.
5.	AMINI Standard Forms Table (165 entries). This table contains typological and chronological information for the amphora typologies identified in Northern Italy. 

## Red-Slipped Finewares in Northern Italy (REFINI)
The REFINI database contains 12,112 sherds of red-slipped finewares (terra sigillata and ARS) from 25 urban sites across Northern Italy. It comprises of five interconnected tables, the contents of which are outlined as follows.
1.	REFINI Catalogue Table (12,112 entries). This is the main database table which holds a single entry for each fineware sherd. It lists detailed information about the sherd and includes a link to all other tables in the database. Epigraphic data is also recorded in this table. 
2.	REFINI Deposits Table (162 entries). This table contains chronological and contextual information about the archaeological deposit in which fineware sherds listed in the Catalogue table were found. 
3.	REFINI Locations Table (25 entries). This table contains information about each urban site in which fineware sherds listed in the Catalogue table were found.
4.	REFINI Publications Table (61 entries). This table contains information on each publication that recorded the fineware sherds found in the Catalogue table.
5.	REFINI Standard Forms Table (630 entries). This table contains typological and chronological information for the fineware typologies identified in Northern Italy.

## Decorative Stone and Marble in Northern Italy (DESTINI)
The DESTINI dataset contains 18,308 fragments of decorative stone from 13 sites from Northern Italy. The stone recorded in DESTINI was primarily revetment, used as paving or cladding, but also contains other small architectural features such as cornices and wainscotting. It comprises of five interconnected tables, the contents of which are outlined as follows.
1.	DESTINI Catalogue Table (18,308 entries). This is the main database table which holds a single entry for each fragment. It lists detailed information about the fragment and includes a link to all other tables in the database. 
2.	DESTINI Deposits Table (19 entries). This table contains chronological and contextual information about the archaeological deposit in which fragments listed in the Catalogue table were found. 
3.	DESTINI Locations Table (13 entries). This table contains information about each urban site in which fragments listed in the Catalogue table were found.
4.	DESTINI Publications Table (14 entries). This table contains information on each publication that recorded the fragments found in the Catalogue table.
5.	DESTINI Stone Types Table (62 entries). This table contains typological and chronological information for the lithotypes identified in Northern Italy.
